# graph_builder
Cool Graph Builder with GUI.<br>
Built as input program for my [Graph Object](https://github.com/ariel-weiss/graph_object) project.
### Drawing Nodes:
Click on the red canvas to draw nodes.<br>
### Connecting Nodes:
Right-click on a node to enter "connecting mode".<br>
Then right-click on another node to draw an arrow between them (connect them).<br>
Or, If you don't want to connect the node, right-click again on the selected node to exit 'connecting mode'.<br>
### Export Graph:
Click the 'Export Graph' button to write your graph into text file, model.txt<br>
<br>
### Example:
The following graph-<br>
![Example](example.png?raw=true)
<br>
Exported into this file:<br>
(first the number of nodes, then the edges)<br>
>#6<br>
(1, 4)<br>
(1, 5)<br>
(3, 4)<br>
(2, 6)<br>
